Can this Be Done?\r\n2. Who Needs It?\r\n3. Who Else Does It?\r\n4. What can they do about it?\r\n5. Who Do I Need To Know?\r\n6. How hard is it?\r\n7. When does it need to happen?\r\n8. When is it useless?\r\n9. Where is it useful?\r\n10. What am I missing?\r\n\r\n## The Concept Checklist\r\n    \r\n1. Why should I care?\r\n2. What's it called?\r\n3. What does it do?\r\n4. What's it like?\r\n5. How's it different?\r\n6. Is it new?\r\n7. Who's it for?\r\n8. Why should they care?\r\n9. How do I talk to them?\r\n10. How will they hear about it?\r\n\r\n## The Workload Worksheet\r\n\r\n1. What's the goal?\r\n2. Why does it need to happen?\r\n3. How does it happen?\r\n4. What's the timefame?\r\n5. Is there enough room?\r\n6. Who do I need?\r\n7. What do I need?\r\n8. What's the bottleneck?\r\n9. What could go wrong?\r\n10. What's your backup plan?\r\n\r\n## The Quality Quiz\r\n1. What is done?\r\n2. When is done?\r\n3. Why we're done?\r\n4. Is done forever?\r\n5. What can I do later?\r\n6. What needs to happen now?\r\n7. Why is this important?\r\n8. What makes it perfect?\r\n9. What makes it broken?\r\n10. What do I do when it breaks?\r\n\r\n## The Pricing Primer\r\n\r\n1. How valuable is it?\r\n2. How valuable will it seem?\r\n3. What will it cost me to try?\r\n4. What does it cost me each time?\r\n5. Who helps sell it?\r\n6. What will they get?\r\n7. When will I lose money?\r\n8. When will I stop losing money?\r\n9. Are there competitors?\r\n10. Is cheaper better?\r\n\r\n### Using the Rubrics\r\nThese rubrics are best used introspectively.\r\n\r\nYou can write down your thoughts, but you don't have to.\r\n\r\nYou can pick and choose which of these questions are important to your idea, and how you feel about their answers.\r\n\r\nThese are merely questions you or others might ask about your idea, designed to help refine your ideas and projects.\r\n\r\nI originally wrote these over a decade ago, and have sent them in emails time and again over the years to people pondering problems.\r\n\r\nThe Five Rubrics have been pretty useful to me.\r\n\r\nHopefully, The Five Rubrics will be useful to you.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\nJames",
