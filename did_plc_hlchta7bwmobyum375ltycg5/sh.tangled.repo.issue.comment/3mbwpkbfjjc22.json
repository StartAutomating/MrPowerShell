I just want to figure out how to bring all of the palettes over into the site.standard.\n\nI think there should be the room to grow into both (and maybe a few PowerShell or other scripts to convert between the two).\n\nMaybe the answer is: \n\n* `site.standard.palette.basic`\n* `site.standard.palette.terminal`\n\nAfter all..\n\nA part of me also wants a `site.standard.palette.named`, but, lets be honest, who is going to create a color palette for all of the [named colors in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/named-color) ?  (and, even if that person exists, _should_ they?)",
