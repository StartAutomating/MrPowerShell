And I understand it would technically be a breaking change due to the design of lexicons.\n\nI suggest making the breaking change early, while there are few people to break (and you're still in semver <1 )\n\nI still think the \"theme\" should be a thing, just a slightly different thing.  I am still thinking thru how to formalize the set of wants for this scenario.  Open to suggestions / I might make a new issue.",
