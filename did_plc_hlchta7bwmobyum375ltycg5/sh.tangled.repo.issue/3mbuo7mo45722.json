      "body": "I believe that `site.standard.palette.basic` would be the ideal nomenclature, not `site.standard.theme.basic`.\n\nHere is why I believe `palette` is the correct name:\n\n1. As presently written, this encapsulates a palette, not a complete theme.\n2. Using the term \"palette\" keeps the term \"theme\" open for more complex scenarios.\n3. `palette` provides a clear delineation of purpose between itself and `theme`.  One deals with colors specifically, the other encapsulates UI customizations (for example, if we imagine a holiday theme, it might include a palette but also contain specific shapes/assets to display, different fonts to use, etc)\n4. To me, `palette` implies potential customization, where as theme implies a fixed set of selections.\n\nThese are just my rationale for the name change.  I have a few projects where I had been using either `theme` or `colorScheme` and have since standardized on the lexically correct term, which is `palette`.\n\nMy apologies for such a pedantic issue.  Please consider changing this before too many people take a dependency on standard.site.\n\n \n\n",
