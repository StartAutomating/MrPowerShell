Maintaining them is almost always a way to trap yourself into a cycle of technical debt and pain.\n\nI know this much better than most.  I am not immune.\n\nI have made many frameworks.\n\nA few light ones have proved very useful.\n\nMost of them have not proved their utility with time.\n\nThe best framework is no framework \n\nThe second best framework is a light framework.\n\nThe third best framework is a well-tested stable framework that has barely changed in years.\n\nKeep stuff as close to the language / metal as you can, and live a happier developer life.\n\nTrust me.\n\nI know this lesson painfully well.",
