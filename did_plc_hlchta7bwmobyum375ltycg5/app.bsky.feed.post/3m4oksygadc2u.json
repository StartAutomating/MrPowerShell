          "description": "Alt: The More You Know About PowerShell, the more you realize that just because you can autogenerate commands does not mean you should.\n\nCommands are not APIs, and, while they can have really long command names, you want to make something more friendly.  Commands are designed to be used interactively, and to be a bridge to other ecosystems.  If they are just a reallylongnameforaveryspecificsingleapi, then you're probably not doing the best job of abstracting things.\n\nAlso, in case you don't get the joke: the entire post is in fact a very long legal command name in PowerShell.\n\nSo it's possible to encode a whole frigging joke, with multiple references, into a cmdletname.  And we aren't limited by the size of the cmdletname.  We're limited by the size of the BlueSky post.  PowerShell command names _can_ be as long as you'd like.  They can even be multiple words.  But that's the choice of the language to have few limits.  The choice of a developer to just autogenerate a cmdlet, including a name, from a messy graph api, into a cmdlet name so long it can become a joke.... that's just poor abstraction.\n\nWhich is all a long fun way of saying:\n\n1. Don't knock the open-ended language capability for the bad use.\n2. Think about how you design your commands (at least a little bit)\n3. Make fewer commands that do more, not more commands that do less.",
