Enough old colleagues watched MsExcel and joked that I would be MrPowerShell.\n\nI still kinda bristle with it, but it fits.\n\nI've been doing PowerShell for decades and have written over 27,000,000 lines of code ( and counting ).\n\nSo if I am not MrPowerShell, who is?\n\nEqually importantly, does anyone else have any \"right\" to tell me differently about something I helped make and have been doing for decades?",
