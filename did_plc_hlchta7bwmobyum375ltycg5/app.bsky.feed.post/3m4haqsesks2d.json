          "description": "Alt: Being able to serve up layers of in memory readable and writeable data stores that never touch disk is such a cool technique.  And _extremely_ fast and flexible.\n\nEach part/file has a content type, which makes them easy to serve up.\nWe can read or write to a compressed stream of the part.  This minimizes memory impact, and we can serve by literally copying the stream.\n\nWe can also have an infinite number of layers to read or write to, and only store them to disk when needed.  Bonus points:  If we ever need to store them to disk we get a well-organized zip of logs and data.\n\nAlso, it's way faster to list parts of a package than files in filesystem.\n\nThis technique is truly broken.",
