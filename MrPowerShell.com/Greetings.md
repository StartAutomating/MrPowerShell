# Hey PowerShell People!

Welcome to a personal page from a PowerShell enthusiast.

## Who am I?

I'm James Brundage, and I've been using PowerShell since it's early days.

I was lucky enough to help test and build PowerShell V2 and V3 at Microsoft, 
and I've continued to do amazing things with the language ever since.

I enjoy making hard things easy to do, and I love to share my knowledge with others.

I'm always interested in interesting projects.

If you need the help of a Jack of all trades and master of PowerShell, reach out.
